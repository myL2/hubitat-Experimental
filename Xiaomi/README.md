Shamelessly ripped from markus-li's awesome repo

My logic:

#1 I need my own default settins (eg MinBattery 2.8V, MaxBattery 3.2V) and I'm too lazy to think of a better solution,
#2 I need a faster way to install 5-6 common drivers, and having them all in the same package allows me to tick multiple and saves me time,
#3 Code is pretty stable, haven't had an issue in years.
